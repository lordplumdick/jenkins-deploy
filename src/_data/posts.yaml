  text: As the second planet from the Sun, Venus is our closest neighbor in our solar system.
    Although very similar in size and structure to our Earth,
    Venus spins more slowly and in the opposite direction than most of the planets in our solar system.
- title: Planet Jupiter
  text: Jupiter was named after the Roman king of the gods.
    Itâ€™s the fifth planet from the sun in our solar system and the largest planet of all.
    To give you an idea of how big Jupiter is, you could line up 11 Earths,
    side-by-side just to stretch from one side of Jupiter to the other.
- title: Planet Mars
  text: Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being only larger than Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
